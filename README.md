# C# Tutorial Create a simple binary calculator game using Windows Form and .Net

In this tutorial we will make Binary calculator quiz game using windows form application and Visual Studio. This app will have 9 combo boxes, each combo box will contain either a 0 or 1. A random number will be generated and  the app will ask the user to solve that number in binary. All of the combo boxes have a value marked on top of them so we can select from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256. If the binary number we have added is correct then the program will give us another number to solve or we can keep trying to solve it until we get it. This was a fun application to make because half way through I decided to add all of the components from the C# script. So all the combo boxes and labels are added dynamically from the script. Nothing was added from the tool box. Also the events are added to the program from the script and its also managed in the same script. I think this will give you a better idea on how to create a simple app just from the script and have it work jus the way you want it to.
